#Pandas tutorial

This tutorial is basically copied and pasted from the work at https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook

I actually learnt using this brilliant youtube presentation; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnMutdy6Fw&list=LLFpzBjeDe4iXqrOADl5ZNMg&index=52

if the link is dead - 'brandon rhodes pandas from the ground up' in youtube should do the trick

He has a link to a github repo with some great examples. Goes into way more detail on groupby, sort functions.
